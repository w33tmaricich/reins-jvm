;;;; Guardian Agent. A guardian agent is a subset of carrier agent. Its purpose is to watch for agents attempting to enter the network. Guardians check to see if the entering agent is allowed to be on the network. If so, it will allow it entry and allow it to be executed. Some guardians can be used to carry agents through a network, to another network. Guardians are essentally an agent transmission protocol locally through a network.
