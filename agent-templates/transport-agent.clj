;;;; Transport Agent. Contains a method of moving agents via some transport protocol. An agent moves into the transport agent, and the transport agent sends it away via some protocol. Transport agents are not carrier agents. They take in an agent, and send agents via a protocol. This is analogous of sending chel through a portal, and not chel moving around on her own.
