# waldo

Waldo is a library and executor that can be used to create mobile agents written in Clojure. Mobile agents, by definition, are a combination of computer software and data which is able to migrate from one computer to another autonomously and continue its execution on the destination computer. Waldo aims at making this type of software easy to write, while still providing the safty and security we come to expect in modern applications. 

## Installation

This application is still in the early alpha stages. As time pogresses, I will fill in the nessisary requirements for installation. The current goal is to provide a simple application that runs on the JVM that you install on your system as well as any system you wish your application to migrate to. I will also provide the library for writing these types of applications.

## Usage

FIXME: Insert the actual installation information here.

    $ java -jar waldo-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

FIXME: I expect that there will be many options when configuring the executor. They will go here at a later date
